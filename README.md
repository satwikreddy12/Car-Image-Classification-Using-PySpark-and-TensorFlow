###Overview<br/>
The project focuses on classifying car images into categories based on manufacturers (e.g., Mazda, Nissan, Toyota, etc.). The images are processed and categorized using PySpark for large-scale data handling, and TensorFlow/Keras is used to build a neural network model for image classification. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets for model evaluation.

###Methodology<br/>
Data Loading: Images are loaded from a local dataset, and the file paths are stored in a PySpark DataFrame for scalable processing.
Data Splitting: The dataset is split into three sets: 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.
Feature Extraction: Image features are extracted using TensorFlowâ€™s load_img and img_to_array functions.
Model Training: A neural network model is built using TensorFlow/Keras to classify the car images into different manufacturer categories.
Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using the validation and test sets.
